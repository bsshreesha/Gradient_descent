# Gradient Descent Visualization

This repository contains a Python implementation of the gradient descent algorithm with visualizations using Matplotlib and Plotly. The project includes both 2D and interactive visualizations, and demonstrates the mathematical computations involved in gradient descent.

## Project Overview

The code performs gradient descent on the function \( f(x, y) = x^2y + y^2 \). It calculates both the first-order and second-order partial derivatives and visualizes the gradient descent process on a contour plot. Annotations and LaTeX formatting are used to enhance understanding.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SymPy
- Matplotlib
- Plotly
- IPython (for LaTeX display in Jupyter notebooks)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy sympy matplotlib plotly ipython
